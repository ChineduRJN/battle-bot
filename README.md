## Components Used
- **Arduino Mega + Shield**
- **2 Ã— BTS7960 43A Motor Drivers**
- **GOOLRC 35A Brushless ESC**
- **Flysky FS-i6X Transmitter & Receiver**
- **DC Motors (for wheels)**
- **Brushless Motor (for weapon)**
- **Step-down voltage converter**
- **Li-ion Batteries**
- **Custom PCBs**

## Features
- Dual BTS7960 drivers for high-torque motor control
- Brushless weapon control via ESC
- Wireless joystick control using FS-i6X and PWM channels
- Compact wiring using custom PCBs
- Modular power system with voltage regulation

---

## Control Logic
- Channels from the Flysky receiver control:
  - LPWM/RPWM for wheel direction
  - EN pins for motor enable/disable
  - ESC for weapon motor control
- Arduino Mega processes PWM input signals and converts them to motor commands
